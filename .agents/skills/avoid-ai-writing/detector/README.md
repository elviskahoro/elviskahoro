# Detector engine

`patterns.js` is the executable expression of this skill's pattern rules — a
zero-dependency, build-step-free detection engine that scores text for
AI-writing tells. It runs identically in Node (`>=18`) and in the browser.

The skill's `SKILL.md` is the human-readable catalog of rules; this engine is
the deterministic, testable implementation of the regex-detectable subset, plus
stylometric and AI-tool-fingerprint detectors that don't make sense as prose.
See [`CATEGORIES.md`](./CATEGORIES.md) for the rule ↔ category mapping that keeps
the two in sync.

## Run it

```bash
npm test          # pattern, category-contract, and preservation tests (no deps)
# or directly:
node detector/patterns.test.js
```

```js
const AIDetector = require("./detector/patterns.js");
const result = AIDetector.analyzeText("Your text here…");
console.log(result.score, result.label, result.issues.length);
```

In the browser, load `patterns.js` as a plain script — it self-registers as a
global `AIDetector` (the `module.exports` block is guarded and only runs under
CommonJS).

## `analyzeText(text, options?)` → result

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `score` | `0–100` | 0 = clean, 100 = heavy AI |
| `label` | string | `Minimal` / `Some` / `Strong` / `Heavy` (or `Empty` / `Too short` / `Text too long`) |
| `issues[]` | `{type, text, severity, …}` | one entry per detected pattern; `type` keys map to [`CATEGORIES.md`](./CATEGORIES.md) |
| `stats` | object | `wordCount`, per-tier counts, `contextMode`, `denseAIVocab`, normalization flags, etc. |
| `document_classification` | string | trinary `HUMAN_ONLY` / `MIXED` / `AI_ONLY` (shape mirrors GPTZero for swap-in) |
| `class_probabilities` | `{human, mixed, ai}` | sums to exactly 1.0 |
| `confidence_category` | `low` / `medium` / `high` | |
| `highlight_sentence_for_ai` | region[] | sentence spans with byte offsets + per-region score, for UI highlighting |

`options.contextMode` accepts `general` (default) or `technical`; technical mode
suppresses flags that are legitimate in code-adjacent prose (e.g. Title Case
headers). Invalid modes fall back to `general` and set `stats.contextModeFallback`.

## `validate(original, rewritten, options?)` → result

`validate.js` checks that a rewrite kept its hands off the things `SKILL.md`
says not to touch. Edit mode writes to files, so a violation there is silent
and destructive.

```js
const { validate, formatResult } = require("./detector/validate.js");
const result = validate(originalText, rewrittenText);
if (!result.ok) console.error(formatResult(result));
```

```bash
node detector/validate.js before.md after.md   # exits 1 on a preservation error
```

**Errors** (the rewrite altered content it had no business touching): fenced
code modified or dropped, YAML frontmatter changed, blockquote reworded, table
cell changed, inline code removed, URL or file path lost, heading count or
nesting changed, and `residual-grew` when the rewrite introduces more flagged
patterns than it removes.

**Warnings** (usually legitimate, occasionally a mistake): heading reworded,
a figure from the original missing, more than 40% of the words dropped.

Two edits this skill documents as correct are carved out so the validator never
fires on its own instructions: stripping AI tracking parameters from URLs
(`utm_source=chatgpt.com`), and rewording a heading to fix Title Case or remove
an emoji. Indented code blocks are counted but not enforced, since four-space
indentation is also how markdown continues a list item.

## Scoring our own docs

```bash
npm run self-scan          # table
npm run self-scan:check    # exits 1 if a document is over budget (runs in CI)
```

Results and the findings it surfaced are in [`../PROOF.md`](../PROOF.md).

## Design notes

- **FN-biased.** False positives damage trust more than false negatives, so
  `MIXED` is wide and `AI_ONLY` requires multiple corroborating signals.
- **Scoring is non-linear.** Repeated hits of the same phrase are deduplicated;
  category weights live in the `ISSUE_WEIGHTS` table.
- **Length gates.** Under ~10 words → `Too short` (unscorable); over 10k words →
  `Text too long`.
