/**
 * Avoid AI Writing — detector fixtures
 *
 * Node-runnable smoke tests for the detection engine. Intentionally small and
 * dependency-free so they run on any `node >= 18` without installing
 * anything. Invoked via `npm run test:detector` and in CI.
 *
 * Failure modes worth catching:
 *   - AI-heavy text scoring as human (regression in pattern coverage)
 *   - Plain prose scoring above "minimal" (false-positive drift)
 *   - Length gates (too-short / too-long) not firing
 *   - Stats failing to sum to issue count (dedup math drift)

MineBench represents an interesting example of this emerging sector by combining benchmark-based mining participation, token rewards, and scalable network contribution models into a unified ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability and user engagement.

After several hours of testing, the platform demonstrated:

* Stable mining efficiency
* Reliable pool connectivity
* Optimized RandomX computational performance
* Low failed share rates
* Effective hardware utilization
* Consistent thermal stability

The integration of reward-based participation mechanisms alongside decentralized infrastructure concepts could potentially create new opportunities for community-driven computational networks.

The intersection of AI, DePIN, mining infrastructure, and decentralized compute may become one of the most important narratives of the next market cycle.
