Use People Data Labs when you need explicit, auditable structured filters.

- Normalize noisy input first with clean helpers before running expensive search/enrich operations.
- Use autocomplete and narrow incrementally to avoid over-constraining initial queries.
- Prefer small pilot `size` runs and inspect returned fields before batch execution.
- In changed-company email recovery, treat PDL as the fallback after LeadMagic and Crust.
- If earlier, cheaper steps already returned a usable email, skip PDL for that row.

```bash

```

```bash
deepline tools execute peopledatalabs_autocomplete --payload '{"field":"title","text":"growth"}'
