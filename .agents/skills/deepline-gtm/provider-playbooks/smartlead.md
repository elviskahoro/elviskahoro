Use Smartlead for outbound email campaign management. Full lifecycle from campaign creation through lead push, scheduling, sequencing, and monitoring.

- Keep activation behind enrichment/verification gates -- only push contacts that have been validated.
- Resolve campaign IDs from `smartlead_list_campaigns` before any write operation.
- Push leads in batches of up to 400 and re-check campaign stats after writes.
- Keep Smartlead traffic at or below 60 requests per 60 seconds per API key. Large pools need queueing or smaller concurrency.
- Always configure sequences and schedule before starting a campaign.
- Include `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY` as fallback env credential when not using org-linked auth.
- Keep payloads provider-native. There is no shared outbound standard contract for Smartlead.

## Workflow

1. **Create or list campaigns** to get a stable campaign ID.
2. **Add email accounts** to the campaign using `smartlead_add_campaign_email_account`.
3. **Configure sequences** with `smartlead_save_campaign_sequences` (email steps, delays, variants).
4. **Set the schedule** with `smartlead_update_campaign_schedule` (timezone, days, hours, send rate).
5. **Configure settings** with `smartlead_update_campaign_settings` (tracking, stop conditions).
6. **Push leads** in batches (max 400) using `smartlead_push_to_campaign`.
7. **Start the campaign** with `smartlead_update_campaign_status` (status: `START`).
8. **Monitor** via `smartlead_get_campaign_stats` and `smartlead_get_campaign_analytics`.

## Response Shape Contract

Deepline wraps all provider payloads in a standard result envelope: `{ data, meta }`.

- `smartlead_list_campaigns` -> `result.data` is an array of Smartlead campaign objects with stable `id`, `name`, and `status` fields plus the upstream metadata returned by Smartlead.
- `smartlead_get_campaign_stats` -> `result.data` contains `{ sent, opened, clicked, replied, bounced }`, mapped from Smartlead `/analytics` root counters.
- `smartlead_push_to_campaign` -> `result.data` contains `{ pushed, failed, results }`.
- `smartlead_create_campaign` -> `result.data` includes `{ ok, id, name, created_at }`.
- `smartlead_export_campaign_leads` -> `result.data` is raw CSV text.
- `smartlead_list_campaign_leads` -> `result.data` is a paginated list of lead objects.
- `smartlead_get_campaign_analytics_by_date` -> `result.data` contains daily stats breakdown.

## Gotchas

- **`min_time_btw_emails` vs `min_time_btwn_emails`:** The schedule endpoint accepts both field names. `min_time_btw_emails` is canonical; `min_time_btwn_emails` is the legacy alias. At least one must be provided. The validator normalizes the legacy alias to the canonical field.
- **Campaign status values:** Only `PAUSED`, `STOPPED`, and `START` are valid. Note it is `START`, not `STARTED` or `RUNNING`.
- **Timezone handling:** `update_campaign_schedule` requires an IANA timezone string (e.g. `America/New_York`). The schedule uses 24-hour `HH:MM` format for `start_hour` and `end_hour`, and `start_hour` must be strictly before `end_hour`.
- **Days of the week:** 0 = Sunday through 6 = Saturday. At least one day is required.
- **Sequence ordering:** `seq_number` values must be contiguous starting at 1 (no gaps). The first sequence step (seq_number 1) must have a subject line (either at step level or on every variant).
- **Delay units:** `delay_in_days` is in days (0 = immediate). Do not pass hours or minutes.
- **Lead batch limits:** Maximum 400 leads per `push_to_campaign` call. Use `lead_list` as the canonical field; Deepline still accepts `leads` as a compatibility alias. Duplicate emails within a batch are rejected. Emails are automatically lowercased for deduplication.
- **Provider rate limit:** Smartlead currently documents 60 requests per 60 seconds per API key. Avoid high parallelism on campaign mutations unless you add queueing or backoff.
- **Analytics date range:** `get_campaign_analytics_by_date` enforces a maximum 30-day window between `start_date` and `end_date`. Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **Track settings normalization:** `update_campaign_settings` accepts either a single string or an array for `track_settings`. Valid values: `DONT_TRACK_EMAIL_OPEN`, `DONT_TRACK_LINK_CLICK`, `DONT_TRACK_REPLY_TO_AN_EMAIL`.
- **Stop lead settings:** Valid values: `REPLY_TO_AN_EMAIL`, `CLICK_ON_A_LINK`, `OPEN_AN_EMAIL`.
- **Block list entries:** Each entry must be a valid domain (`example.com`) or email address (`user@example.com`). URLs with protocol prefixes or paths are rejected.
- **Lead fetch by email:** Smartlead returns HTTP `200 {}` for missing or malformed emails. Deepline converts that upstream empty-object case into `no_result`.
- **Campaign unsubscribe:** Smartlead can return HTTP `200 {"ok":false}` for an unknown lead. Deepline treats that as an explicit failure rather than a successful unsubscribe.
- **Campaign lead export:** The export endpoint returns `text/csv`, so downstream steps should parse `result.data` as CSV text, not JSON.
- **Webhook event types:** `EMAIL_SENT`, `EMAIL_OPEN`, `EMAIL_LINK_CLICK`, `EMAIL_REPLY`, `LEAD_UNSUBSCRIBED`, `LEAD_CATEGORY_UPDATED`.
- **Campaign IDs:** Accepted as integer or numeric string. Non-numeric strings are rejected.
- **Reply thread:** `reply_email_time` must be a full ISO datetime (e.g. `2026-01-15T09:30:00.000Z`). Date-only strings are rejected.
- **Client permissions:** Only `reply_master_inbox` and `full_access` are valid. Client passwords must be at least 8 characters.
- **API key auth:** Pass `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY` environment variable. The API key is appended as a query parameter by the integration layer.
