# Enriching and Researching (JTBD Draft)

Use this doc for row-level enrichment, research, waterfalls, validation, coalescing, and custom per-row transforms.

This doc does **not** cover list building, source discovery, or TAM/provider scouting before you have rows. If you do not yet have a seed list, source URL, or known entities, stop and use `finding-companies-and-contacts.md`.

## Core rule

If a play exists, use it first. Use manual provider chains only when:

- no play exists
- you need to customize provider order or extractor behavior
- you are testing a niche provider patha
  Run deepline enrich in the foreground so you don't waste tokens while it completes.

## Scenario table

| Scenario                                                   | Use when                                                                                                                                                                 | Default play/tool                                                   | Why                                                                                                                                             |

| Name + domain -> work email | You have name + domain (or can resolve domain from company_name / Sales Nav URL first) | `Name + domain -> work email` | Canonical deterministic path. Handles both direct and domain-first-then-waterfall cases. |
| LinkedIn URL -> work email | Standard `/in/` LinkedIn URL + name. `domain` optional; include if known for extra coverage. | `LinkedIn URL -> work email` | Works with or without domain. Do NOT use for SN `/sales/lead/` URLs — resolve domain first and use the name+domain play. |
| Email -> person/company context | You have an inbound or work email and need person + company details | `Email -> person/company context` | Good for hydrating context from a single strong identifier. |

## Notes

- Plays are the default surface for common enrichment jobs.
- **Personal vs work emails:** When the user asks for "personal emails", they mean Gmail/Hotmail/Yahoo - NOT work emails. **NEVER** substitute work email providers (Apollo, Hunter, LeadMagic) when personal emails are requested. Use Fullenrich (`contact.personal_emails`) or BetterContact. If one fails, try the other - do not fall back to work email providers.
- Direct provider tools are preferred for mechanical fields when no play exists.
- `run_javascript` is for deterministic transforms, normalization, coalescing, templating, and cheap row-level glue logic.
- `deeplineagent` is the default AI path for research, synthesis, custom signals, and classification when JS is not enough.
- Domain lookup / homepage recovery is mechanical. Use `exa_search` with rich context or `serper_google_search`, not `deeplineagent`.
- Persona lookup means "find candidate contacts at a company for a target role or seniority." Treat that as a dedicated play, not as generic research.
- Validate after recovery or coalescing, not during each waterfall step.
- For contact-to-email work, route by the strongest identifiers you already have: name + company + domain -> `Name + domain -> work email`, name + company only (no domain) OR Sales Navigator contacts -> resolve domain first, then use `name_and_domain_to_email_waterfall`, standard `/in/` LinkedIn URL + name -> `LinkedIn URL -> work email` whether or not `domain` is present, name + domain -> `First + last + domain -> work email`.
- **Sales Navigator exports**: `linkedin_url` values in `/sales/lead/` format are rejected by every provider (dropleads, crustdata, deepline_native, PDL). Do not pass them directly to any email waterfall. Resolve the company domain first, then use `name_and_domain_to_email_waterfall`.
- If you got contacts from a people search (e.g. dropleads_search_people) and they have **standard `/in/`** LinkedIn URLs, use `person_linkedin_to_email_waterfall`. Add `domain` when you have it, but it is not required. This rule does NOT apply to Sales Navigator `/sales/lead/` URLs.
- Validation interpretation: `valid` is deliverable, `catch_all` is usable but riskier, `invalid` should be dropped, and `unknown` is unresolved.
- Phone recovery usually comes later in the pipeline than email or LinkedIn recovery.
- Prefer inline code for short `run_javascript` transforms. Only move code into files when the logic is long, reused, or too awkward to keep inline.
- Never start a second enrich run against the same `--output` file while another enrich is still running. The `.deepline.lock` directory is a safety mechanism, not a bug. Wait for the first run to finish or write to a different output path.

## Plays

### Name + domain -> work email

Play tool: `name_and_domain_to_email_waterfall`

**Required payload:** `first_name`, `last_name`, `domain`. `company_name` is not part of the payload.

**Routing by what you have:**

| You have | Action |
|---|---|
| name + domain | Use the play directly |
| name + company_name (no domain) or SN `/sales/lead/` URLs | Resolve domain first (below), then use the play |
| standard `/in/` LinkedIn URL + name | Skip this play — use `LinkedIn URL -> work email` |

**Play internals.** Runs 8 validated patterns first: `first.last@domain`, `firstlast@domain`, `first_last@domain`, `first-last@domain`, `firstinitiallast@domain`, `firstlastinitial@domain`, `first@domain`, `last@domain`. Pattern hits only count when validator returns `valid` (not `catch_all`). Falls through to `dropleads_email_finder -> hunter_email_finder -> leadmagic_email_finder -> crustdata_persondb_search -> peopledatalabs_enrich_contact`. `catch_all` is operationally usable for outreach but not counted as an automatic waterfall win inside the play.

**Example:**

```bash
deepline enrich --input leads.csv --output leads_with_emails.csv --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"email","tool":"name_and_domain_to_email_waterfall","payload":{"first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}"}}'
```

**Domain-first resolution** — when you only have `company_name` or a SN `/sales/lead/` URL, resolve domain, then run the play (3 passes):

```bash
deepline enrich --input contacts.csv --output out.csv \
  --with '{"alias":"exa_raw","tool":"exa_search","payload":{"query":"{{company_name}} official website","numResults":1}}'
deepline enrich --input out.csv --in-place \
  --with '{"alias":"domain","tool":"run_javascript","payload":{"code":"const cell=row.exa_raw;const raw=(cell&&typeof cell===\"object\"&&\"result\" in cell)?cell.result:cell;const results=Array.isArray(raw?.results)?raw.results:[];const url=(results[0]&&results[0].url)||\"\";const m=url.match(/^https?:\\/\\/(www\\.)?([^\\/]+)/);return row.company_domain||(m?m[2]:null)||null;"}}'
deepline enrich --input out.csv --in-place \
  --with '{"alias":"email","tool":"name_and_domain_to_email_waterfall","payload":{"first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}"}}'
```

Exa `extract_js` doesn't work inline here, so `run_javascript` extracts the domain from the saved cell — unwrap `cell.result` first (the cell shape is `{ result, matched_result? }`).

### LinkedIn URL -> work email

Play tool: `person_linkedin_to_email_waterfall`

**Required payload:** `linkedin_url`, `first_name`, `last_name`.
**Optional:** `domain` — include when available to unlock extra deterministic finder steps before LinkedIn-native fallbacks.

Use when contacts have a **standard `/in/`** LinkedIn URL (e.g. from `dropleads_search_people`). Domain is optional — the play works off the LinkedIn URL directly.

**Do NOT use for Sales Navigator `/sales/lead/` URLs** — providers reject them. Resolve the company domain first, then use the name+domain play above.

**Example:**

```bash
deepline enrich --input contacts.csv --output contacts_with_emails.csv --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"email","tool":"person_linkedin_to_email_waterfall","payload":{"linkedin_url":"{{linkedin_url}}","first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}"}}'
```

### Email -> person/company context

Problem category: reverse enrichment from a known email.  
Input profile: `email`.  
Output target: hydrated person and company context.

Play tool: `deepline_native_enrich_contact`

Why this play:

- Email is a strong identifier; use it directly.
- Good for backfilling person/company fields after email recovery.
- This is hydration, not research.

Example:

```bash
deepline enrich --input inbound.csv --output inbound_enriched.csv --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"person_context","tool":"deepline_native_enrich_contact","payload":{"email":"{{email}}"}}'
```

### Contact identity -> phone

Problem category: contact-to-phone recovery.  
Input profile: `first_name`, `last_name`, `domain`, with optional `email` and `linkedin_url`.  
Output target: one best phone number for the contact.

Play tool: `contact_to_phone_waterfall`

Why this play:

- Use it when you already know the person identity and want the highest-signal phone lookup order.
- Cost-optimized: starts with the cheapest providers and escalates to expensive ones only as fallbacks.
- All providers charge only on successful hit (post_deduct), so total cost scales with coverage, not attempts.
- Follow up with `trestle_phone_validation` to verify line type, carrier, and activity score before outbound.

Play details:

- Required inputs are `first_name`, `last_name`, and `domain`.
- `email` and `linkedin_url` are optional hints that unlock additional provider paths.
- The play handles the phone provider order internally. Treat the play as the source of truth for exact sequencing.
- LeadMagic runs in two gated forms inside the play: LinkedIn-based when `linkedin_url` exists, and email-based when `email` exists.
- For async multi-provider waterfalls (BetterContact, FullEnrich) that aggregate 20+ sources internally, use them as manual enrichment steps outside the play when the native waterfall misses.

Example:

```bash
deepline enrich --input contacts.csv --output contacts_with_phones.csv --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"phone_from_contact","tool":"contact_to_phone_waterfall","payload":{"first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}","email":"{{email}}","linkedin_url":"{{linkedin_url}}"}}'
```

### Company -> persona lookup

Problem category: account-to-contact persona lookup.  
Input profile: `company_name`, `domain`, `roles`, and `seniority`. `domain` is required.  
Output target: candidate contacts for the requested persona.

Play tool: `company_to_contact_by_role_waterfall`

Why this play:

- This is the canonical company-to-persona play when you have a company domain.
- Use it for both role-targeted and seniority-targeted contact discovery.
- The right default for prompts like "find GTM engineers at these companies".
- Prefer exact title tokens in `roles` when the user intent is specific, for example `CEO`, `Founder`, `CTO`, `CMO`, `VP Marketing`, `Head of Security`, `Director of Engineering`, `RevOps`.
- Use broader functional roles only when the user intent is genuinely broad, for example `marketing`, `security`, `finance`, `product`, `engineering`, `sales`, `growth`. Broad roles are useful, but they are noisier and often return adjacent titles.
- A good default is 1-3 exact titles, or a broad function plus a strong level hint if exact titles are not known.
- `seniority` is a first-class input, but it is only a level hint. Use portable values like `C-Level`, `Founder`, `VP`, `Head`, `Director`, `Manager`, `Senior`, `Entry`, `Intern`. Do not send raw provider enums like `c_level` unless you are bypassing the play and calling a provider directly.
- Do not assume the play will invent hidden row-level provider fields for you. For interpolated CSV runs, `roles` and `seniority` pass through exactly as provided.
- Clean contract: pass a company domain. If you only have a LinkedIn company URL, resolve the domain first before using this play.

Provider behavior to remember:

- `dropleads` is strongest when `roles` contains exact title tokens.
- `deepline_native` translates portable roles into provider-safe boolean title-filter expressions. This is most useful when `roles` contains specific leadership intent like `CEO`, `Founder`, `CTO`, `VP Marketing`, `Head of Security`, or `Director of Engineering`.
- `apollo` is useful for exact title search, but do not depend on it as the only source for founder/exec startup cases.
- `icypeas` is a strong fallback for exact profile-style role searches, especially founders and startup operators.
- `prospeo` and `crustdata` are structured fallbacks, not reasons to jump to `deeplineagent`.
- If the user asks for a very specific persona and you only have a broad function, refine the role phrasing first before adding more providers.

Practical input patterns:

- Exact exec intent: `CEO`, `Founder`, `Co-Founder`, `CTO`, `CFO`, `CMO`, `CISO`
- Exact management intent: `VP Marketing`, `Head of Security`, `Director of Engineering`, `Revenue Operations`
- Broad functional intent: `marketing`, `finance`, `security`, `product`, `engineering`, `sales`, `growth`
- Good broad + level combos: `engineering + VP`, `security + Head`, `finance + Director`
- Avoid relying on level-only phrasing like `C-Level` without a role.

Operational rule:

- If you only have `company_name`, resolve the domain first, then run persona lookup.
- Do not use `deeplineagent` as the first pass for persona lookup.
- Use `deeplineagent` only as a fallback research pass when the play and direct providers miss.
- If provider results are weak or sparse, first re-check the available people/company search tools with category searches, then use Apify if you need a broader employee list.

Category searches:

- Use `people_search` when you need better title- and LinkedIn-oriented contact search options.
- Use `company_search` when you need stronger company identity resolution or company-level inputs before the people search.

Search examples:

```bash
deepline tools search --categories people_search --search_terms "title filters,linkedin"
deepline tools search --categories company_search --search_terms "structured filters,firmographics"
```

Apify fallback:

- Prefer an Apify company-employees actor when the default provider mix is not finding enough good contacts.
- This is especially useful when structured people-search providers have thin coverage for a startup or an unusual title.
- Pull the employee list first, then filter for the target persona rather than trying to force more provider retries.
- Apify is slower, which is why it is a fallback rather than the default first pass.

Example:

```bash
deepline enrich --input accounts.csv --output accounts_with_contacts.csv --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"role_contacts","tool":"company_to_contact_by_role_waterfall","payload":{"company_name":"{{company_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}","roles":"{{roles}}","seniority":"{{seniority}}"}}'
```

Apify example:

```bash
deepline tools execute apify_run_actor_sync --payload '{"actorId":"apimaestro/linkedin-company-employees-scraper-no-cookies","input":{"identifier":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/","max_employees":100},"timeoutMs":180000}'
```

### LinkedIn post URL -> list of engagers

Play tool: `linkedin_post_to_engagers`

Scrapes reactors/commenters from a LinkedIn post. No actor discovery or pagination needed. Can be called via `deepline tools execute` (single post) or `deepline enrich` (batch).
Do NOT use if you need comments only (use `unseenuser/linkedin-post-comment-reaction-extractor-no-cookies`) or full profiles (add a separate scraping step after).

```bash
deepline tools execute linkedin_post_to_engagers --payload '{"post_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/...","max_items":1000}'
```

### List of people with name + position -> ICP qualification

Play tool: `engagers_to_icp_qualification`

Classifies a person against an ICP using name + position/headline. Returns `{icp_tier, icp_reason}`. Do NOT use if qualification needs company size, funding, or web research — use a custom `deeplineagent` prompt instead.

```bash
deepline enrich --input engagers.csv --output qualified.csv --rows 0:5 \
  --with '{"alias":"icp","tool":"engagers_to_icp_qualification","payload":{"first_name":"{{FIRST_NAME}}","last_name":"{{LAST_NAME}}","position":"{{POSITION}}","icp_description":"Tier 1: VP/Head of Engineering, CTO at B2B SaaS. Tier 2: Senior engineers. Tier 3: everyone else."}}'
```

### Company name only -> resolve domain first

Problem category: domain lookup / homepage recovery.  
Input profile: `company_name` plus any contextual hints you already have.  
Output target: canonical `domain` or homepage for downstream plays.

Default tools: `exa_search` or `serper_google_search`

Why this play:

- Domain lookup is mechanical.
- It should happen before persona lookup, email recovery, or company enrichment.
- `deeplineagent` is the wrong default here because this is a search-and-resolve task, not a synthesis task.

Routing rule:

1. Resolve domain/homepage with `exa_search` or `serper_google_search`.
2. Run the downstream play using the recovered domain.
3. Only use `deeplineagent` if provider/search outputs still do not cover the factual need and you need tool-backed reasoning to resolve the ambiguity.

Example:

```bash
deepline enrich --input accounts.csv --output accounts_with_domains.csv --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"homepage_search","tool":"serper_google_search","payload":{"query":"\"{{company_name}}\" official site","num":5}}'
```

### Manual email waterfall

Problem category: custom provider ordering or custom extraction behavior.  
Input profile: varies by target field.  
Output target: same as the native play, but with explicit provider control.

Default surface: `--with-waterfall` plus direct providers

Why this play:

- Use only when no native play fits or when you need to deliberately customize provider order.
- Keeps mechanical enrichment mechanical.
- This is still preferable to starting with `deeplineagent` for deterministic fields.

Key waterfall rules:

- Always pilot first with `--rows 0:1`, then scale after the shape looks right.
- Every waterfall step needs its own `extract_js`. Before writing it: run `deepline tools get <tool>` to see the response shape, then confirm the path from the normalized wrapper. `extract_js` receives `{ result: <tool output> }`, so author paths against `result.*` and only drill into `result.data.*` when that provider's payload actually nests under `data`. Use `@path/to/file.js` for multi-line or regex-heavy JS — inline JS in `--with` JSON breaks on escapes.
- Close each waterfall with `--end-waterfall` before starting another one.
- Do not run email waterfalls without minimum match data: name + company, name + domain, or a strong LinkedIn-seeded identity.
- If you need different validation behavior, remember the native cost-aware play only accepts pattern hits when the validator says `valid`.
- Gating: `--with` accepts exactly these keys: `alias`, `tool`, `payload`, `extract_js`. Gate conditional logic with a preceding `run_javascript` step whenever you need row-level conditions.

Example:

```bash
deepline enrich --input leads.csv --in-place --rows 0:1 \
  --with-waterfall "email" \
  --with '{"alias":"dropleads","tool":"dropleads_email_finder","payload":{"first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","company_name":"{{company_name}}","company_domain":"{{domain}}"},"extract_js":"(output_data) => extract(\"dropleads_email_finder\", output_data, \"email\")"}' \
  --with '{"alias":"hunter","tool":"hunter_email_finder","payload":{"first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}"},"extract_js":"(output_data) => extract(\"hunter_email_finder\", output_data, \"email\")"}' \
  --with '{"alias":"leadmagic","tool":"leadmagic_email_finder","payload":{"first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}"},"extract_js":"(output_data) => extract(\"leadmagic_email_finder\", output_data, \"email\")"}' \
  --end-waterfall \
  --with '{"alias":"email_validation","tool":"leadmagic_email_validation","payload":{"email":"{{email}}"}}'
```

If `extract_js` returns raw objects instead of scalars, you can store the raw response and use `run_javascript` in a second pass to parse it. When debugging, remember the extractor input is wrapped as `{ result: ... }`, while persisted enrich cells usually contain both `result` and `matched_result`.

## Post-enrichment validation

After enrichment, validate data quality before moving to the next phase. Run read-only checks — never modify the enriched CSV during validation.

```bash
# Email domain vs company domain — catches previous-employer or wrong-contact emails
python3 ~/.claude/skills/deepline-gtm/scripts/validate-emails.py enriched.csv \
    --email-col email --domain-col domain
```

Flag and investigate mismatched rows — these are often from a previous employer or a wrong-person match. If >20% of rows mismatch, the contact-finding step likely needs re-running with better company disambiguation.

```bash
# LinkedIn name validation — catches wrong-person matches from search-based lookup
python3 ~/.claude/skills/deepline-gtm/scripts/validate-linkedin-names.py enriched.csv \
    --source-first first_name --source-last last_name --profile-name-col profile_name
```

Null out LinkedIn URLs where names don't match. 26% false positive rate without this gate (tested on 253-person dataset). Eval: `python3 scripts/validate-linkedin-names.py --fixtures scripts/fixtures_name_validation.json`

## Custom enrichment with run_javascript and deeplineagent

Use this section for:

- open-ended factual research
- Claygent alternative
- custom signals
- enrichment that combines multiple sources
- personalization inputs
- prompt-driven enrichment patterns that are not covered by a direct provider field

Default rule:

- use direct providers or plays for mechanical fields
- use `run_javascript` when the job is deterministic row logic: formatting, normalization, coalescing, templating, parsing, or simple conditional transforms
- use `deeplineagent` when the row needs AI help for classification, extraction, scoring, structured generation, browsing, or multi-step synthesis
- split research and generation into separate passes when both are needed
- keep research here; route actual copywriting to `writing-outreach.md`

### Handmade step shape quick reference

Use this when you are hand-authoring `deepline enrich` steps instead of relying on a native play.

- `run_javascript` payload schema: `{"alias":"x","tool":"run_javascript","payload":{"code":"..."}}`
- Inside `run_javascript`, the current row is available as `row`. Read prior columns with `row["column_name"]` or `row.column_name`.
- `run_javascript` returns whatever your JS returns. For example:
  - scalar: `return "acme.com"`
  - object: `return { domain: "acme.com", source: "exa" }`
  - list: `return [{ email: "ada@example.com" }]`
- Provider step with extractor schema: `{"alias":"x","tool":"some_provider","payload":{...},"extract_js":"(output_data) => ..."}`
- `extract_js` input shape is always wrapped: `output_data = { result: <raw tool output> }`
- So inside `extract_js`, author against `output_data.result.*`, not the raw payload root.
- Use `extract("tool_id", output_data, "field")` and `extractList("tool_id", output_data, { keys: [...] })` when possible instead of manually drilling paths.
- Persisted enrich cell shape is different from extractor input.
- For provider-backed enrich columns, the saved cell usually contains the raw provider payload under `result`.
- `matched_result` is the normalized extracted value when Deepline materializes one, for example from result getters or waterfall extraction. It is not the runtime input to `extract_js`; it is a saved post-extraction convenience field.
- That means:
  - in `extract_js`, read `output_data.result`
  - in later `run_javascript` passes over saved CSV rows, read `row["some_column"].result`
  - if the saved cell also has `matched_result`, prefer it as the normalized value you already extracted
  - only drill into provider-specific nesting like `.result.data.*` after unwrapping `result`, and only when that provider's raw payload truly has a `data` envelope

Minimal examples:

```bash
deepline enrich --input in.csv --output out.csv \
  --with '{"alias":"domain","tool":"run_javascript","payload":{"code":"return row.company_name ? row.company_name.toLowerCase().replace(/\\s+/g, \"\") + \".com\" : null;"}}'
```

```bash
deepline enrich --input in.csv --output out.csv \
  --with '{"alias":"email_raw","tool":"hunter_email_finder","payload":{"first_name":"{{first_name}}","last_name":"{{last_name}}","domain":"{{domain}}"},"extract_js":"(output_data) => extract(\"hunter_email_finder\", output_data, \"email\")"}'
```

```bash
deepline enrich --input out.csv --in-place \
  --with '{"alias":"email_domain","tool":"run_javascript","payload":{"code":"const cell=row.email_raw;const raw=(cell&&typeof cell===\"object\"&&\"result\" in cell)?cell.result:cell;const email=cell?.matched_result||raw?.email||raw?.data?.email||null;return email?email.split(\"@\")[1]:null;"}}'
```

### Tiny disambiguation

- Pick `run_javascript` for deterministic logic and cheap row transforms.
- Pick `deeplineagent` when JS is not enough and you need AI help, whether that's research or reasoning over the row.

### Prompt library

Before writing a fresh prompt, inspect [`prompts.json`](prompts.json).

List the top-level keys first. This is the cleanest way to see what prompts already exist:

```bash
jq -r 'keys[]' .skills/deepline-gtm/prompts.json
```

If you want a rough keyword search across the file, use `grep`:

```bash
grep -nE "funding|competitor|personalization|research|signal" .skills/deepline-gtm/prompts.json
```

Use `grep` for broad hunting only. It matches inside prompt bodies too, so the output is often noisy.

Print a specific prompt by key with `jq`:

```bash
jq -r '."5 interesting facts about a candidate"' .skills/deepline-gtm/prompts.json
```

If the prompt key contains quotes or awkward punctuation, first list keys with `jq -r 'keys[]'`, then copy the exact key into the command above.

### Recommended course of action

1. Check whether a play or direct provider already covers the field.
2. Search `prompts.json` for a close starting point.
3. Run a `deeplineagent` research pass first if the task requires web lookup or synthesis.
4. If the next step is copy, sequence writing, scoring copy, or messaging, switch to `writing-outreach.md` and use the research column there.
5. Keep outputs structured with `jsonSchema` when the column is meant to feed later steps.

Practical rule:

- use `jq -r 'keys[]'` to browse prompt names
- use `grep -nE ...` to hunt by keyword
- use `jq -r '."KEY NAME"'` to pull the exact prompt text

### Example: inline custom research column with `deeplineagent`

```bash
deepline enrich --input accounts.csv --in-place --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"account_research","tool":"deeplineagent","payload":{"model":"openai/gpt-5.4-mini","prompt":"Research {{company_name}} ({{domain}}). Return JSON with what_they_build and who_they_sell_to. Keep it brief and use Deepline-managed tools only if needed.","jsonSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"what_they_build":{"type":"string"},"who_they_sell_to":{"type":"string"}},"required":["what_they_build","who_they_sell_to"],"additionalProperties":false}}}'
```

### Example: research pass before writing

```bash
deepline enrich --input leads.csv --output leads_researched.csv --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"company_research","tool":"deeplineagent","payload":{"model":"openai/gpt-5.4-mini","prompt":"Research {{company_name}} ({{domain}}). Return JSON with key pain_points for a buyer considering data enrichment, scoring, or GTM workflow tooling. Keep it brief and use Deepline-managed tools only if needed.","jsonSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"pain_points":{"type":"string"}},"required":["pain_points"],"additionalProperties":false}}}'
```

### Example: classify an existing research column with `deeplineagent`

```bash
deepline enrich --input leads_researched.csv --in-place --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"account_tier","tool":"deeplineagent","payload":{"model":"openai/gpt-5.4-mini","prompt":"Using only the provided context, classify {{company_name}} into one of: high_fit, medium_fit, low_fit. Context: {{company_research}}","jsonSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"tier":{"type":"string","enum":["high_fit","medium_fit","low_fit"]},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["tier","reason"],"additionalProperties":false}}}'
```

### Structured output and interpolation realities

- `deepline tools execute deeplineagent --json` returns the full execute envelope, not just the bare schema object. The structured object lives at `result.result.object` and plain text lives at `result.result.text`.
- In `deepline enrich`, `{{company_research}}` is the safest way to pass a prior `deeplineagent` column into another AI prompt.
- Do not assume `{{company_research.pain_points}}` works for `deeplineagent` structured-output columns in `deepline enrich`. Those cells currently carry an AI result wrapper, so downstream field access is not as clean as a plain flat JSON cell.
- If you need deterministic field-level reuse, add a `run_javascript` flatten pass that emits a new scalar column, then interpolate that scalar column in later steps.
- `row` exists only inside `run_javascript` code. Use `{{company_research}}` in payload templates, and use `row["company_research"]` inside `payload.code`.

### Example: flatten a structured research field before reuse

```bash
deepline enrich --input leads_researched.csv --in-place --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"company_pain_points","tool":"run_javascript","payload":{"code":"const research = row[\"company_research\"]; const extracted = research?.output || research?.extracted_json || research?.result?.object || research; return extracted?.pain_points || null;"}}'
```

Then use the flattened scalar in later prompts:

```bash
deepline enrich --input leads_researched.csv --in-place --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"account_tier","tool":"deeplineagent","payload":{"model":"openai/gpt-5.4-mini","prompt":"Using only the provided context, classify {{company_name}} into one of: high_fit, medium_fit, low_fit. Pain points: {{company_pain_points}}","jsonSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"tier":{"type":"string","enum":["high_fit","medium_fit","low_fit"]},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["tier","reason"],"additionalProperties":false}}}'
```

### Example: adapt a saved prompt from prompts.json

Start by printing the prompt text:

```bash
jq -r '."5 interesting facts about a candidate"' .skills/deepline-gtm/prompts.json
```

Then adapt it into a row-level enrich call for research or custom-signal work:

```bash
deepline enrich --input contacts.csv --in-place --rows 0:1 \
  --with '{"alias":"candidate_facts","tool":"deeplineagent","payload":{"model":"openai/gpt-5.4-mini","prompt":"Using the style of the saved prompt \"5 interesting facts about a candidate\", find five short, source-backed facts about {{full_name}} at {{company_name}}. Use Deepline-managed tools if needed. Return JSON {facts: string[]}.","jsonSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"facts":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["facts"],"additionalProperties":false}}}'
```

For actual email copy, personalized first lines, sequence writing, or scoring language, stop here and route to `writing-outreach.md` with the research columns you just created.

## Working directory (guardrail)

**NEVER write to `/tmp/` or any absolute temp directory** — files in `/tmp/` are wiped on reboot and users have lost paid enrichment outputs. Set up a project-local WORKDIR with a task-descriptive slug (e.g. `deepline/data/acme-email-waterfall`) as step zero. See SKILL.md §3.2 for the full rule.

```bash
WORKDIR="deepline/data/<descriptive-slug>" && mkdir -p "$WORKDIR" && echo "$WORKDIR"
```

## Exit back to discovery

If you realize the task is actually:

- "find the companies first"
- "find the candidate contacts first"
- "where does this data source live?"

Stop and route to `finding-companies-and-contacts.md`. This doc assumes you already have rows or known entities.
