Hi! I'm elvis (he/him/his)

I'm a [Christian]([https://www.epicsf.com/](https://www.epicsf.com/about#vision)) living and working in SF. I grew up in Kennesaw, GA and went to Pomona College [(Erdos #2)](https://pages.pomona.edu/~sg064747/PAPERS/PRBTP.pdf)

I work at [Chalk.ai](https://chalk.ai)--an infrastructure platform for data teams to do real-time machine learning [(loom)](https://www.loom.com/share/2c50068829594de5a5e8d01177ac99d4).

I've starred a lot of repos (> 1k) and I used to organize them into lists; this was becoming to cumbersome to manage so I'm building an app to search for repos with natural language with [Chalk](https://chalk.ai) of course!

I have previously worked at:

- [Warp](https://warp.dev) - a modern cross-platform GPU-accelerated cloud-backed terminal (written in Rust) with AI built in!
- Emory University - doing [NLP/IR in Public Health!](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36534457/)
- Facebook - SWE (Core Growth - MPK21.Z1) right next to Full Circle.

Some tools that give me joy:
