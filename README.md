Hi! I'm elvis (he/him/his)

I'm a [christian]([https://www.epicsf.com/](https://www.epicsf.com/about#vision)) living and working in SF. I grew up in Kennesaw, GA and went to Pomona College.

I'm a developer advocate! I get to work at [Chalk.ai](https://chalk.ai)--an infrastructure platform for teams to do real-time machine learning ([loom](https://www.loom.com/share/a96b36f4ac0a442e9f924bfde4c090de)) Superb DevX around feature engineering!

I've starred a lot of repos (> 1k) and I used to [organize them into lists](https://github.com/elviskahoro?tab=stars); this was becoming to cumbersome to manage so I'm building an app to search for repos with natural language descriptions (vector search). Stay tuned!

I have previously worked at:

- [Warp](https://warp.dev) - a modern cross-platform GPU-accelerated cloud-backed terminal (written in Rust) with AI built in!
- Emory University - doing [NLP/IR in Public Health!](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36534457/)
- Facebook - spent a couple summers interning with core growth working on FB4A at MPK21 in Z1 (next to full circle).
