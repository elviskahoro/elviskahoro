Hi! I'm elvis (he/him/his)

I'm a christian living and working in SF. I grew up in Kennesaw, GA and went to [Pomona College.](https://www.pomona.edu/dos-search/search-committee)

[Erdos #2](https://pages.pomona.edu/~sg064747/PAPERS/PRBTP.pdf)

I'm a developer advocate! I get to work at [Chalk.ai](https://chalk.ai)--a data platform and feature store that enables innovative machine learning teams to focus on building the unique products and models that make their business stand out.

I have previously worked at:

- [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) - an open-source framework empowering Python developers to build internal data, AI and web apps faster with no JavaScript (Frontend. Backend. Pure Python)!
- [Warp](https://warp.dev) - a modern cross-platform GPU-accelerated cloud-backed terminal (written in Rust) with AI built in!
- [Emory University](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36534457/) - doing NLP/IR in Public Health!
- Facebook - spent a couple summers interning with core growth working on FB4A at MPK21 in Z1 (next to full circle).
